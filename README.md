# expense_tracker

This is a dynamic Expense Tracker Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users manage their income and expenses efficiently. The HTML file structures the application into sections such as total balance display, income and expense summary, transaction input fields, and transaction history. The CSS file (expense.css) enhances the user interface with a clean layout, organized balance cards, styled buttons for income and expense selection, and a responsive design for better user experience. The JavaScript file (expense.js) adds functionality by handling user inputs, calculating total balance, updating income and expense values dynamically, and displaying transaction history. It also manages data updates in real time, ensuring accurate financial tracking. This project demonstrates core front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, data calculations, and interactive UI design, making it a practical personal finance management application.
